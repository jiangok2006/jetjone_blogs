Recently I spent a lot of time evaluating dropshipping sourcing from [cjdropshipping](https://www.cjdropshipping.com/). This article is to summarize my learning.

If you don't know, CJdropshipping, headquartered in China, provides dropshippers products sourcing, warehouses, and fulfillment. Similar companies include [Aliexpress](aliexpress.com/), [Spocket](https://www.spocket.co/), etc. I heard different voices about CJ. As a native Chinese speaker and newcomer to dropshipping, I have to try it to know whether it fits me.

To evaluate CJ, I created below stores:
* [a Shopify store](https://jetjone.myshopify.com/) (starter plan)
* [a wed2c store](https://jetjone2.wed2c.com/)
* [an eBay store](https://www.ebay.com/str/jetjone) (starter plan)
* an Amazon store
* a TikTok store
The Shopify and wed2c stores are for content (e.g. blog, YouTube, TikTok) and social (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) marketing. The eBay and Amazon stores do not need marketing but need to comply with platform rules and compete with other sellers on the platform. The TikTok store uses TikTok videos for marketing. These store help evaluate how well CJ support the platforms.


# Profit margin :thumbsdown:
How much is the profit margin compared with products easily found online? Pricing is the number one reason why people source from China, given well-known issues such as no brand or accountable quality, slow/unreliable shipping, and unclear or no return policy. It is silly to assume people do not search and compare before they buy from my store. Lower prices also help products compete with similar products in eBay search.

I randomly sampled several [CJ recommended products](https://www.cjdropshipping.com/boards.html?id=7629).

| product | CJ cost | lowest selling price on google |
|-|-|-|
| [face massage wand](https://www.cjdropshipping.com/product/bone-conduction-speaker-hummingbird-speaker-bone-conduction-audio-speaker-bluetooth-tws-wireless-audio-p-315923C4-CE4D-4FFA-BF55-9D8249EDFBB0.html?push_id=&list=1) | $35 | $12 from temu |
| [cosmetic bag](https://www.cjdropshipping.com/product/smart-led-cosmetic-case-with-mirror-cosmetic-bag-large-capacity-fashion-portable-storage-bag-travel-makeup-bags-p-1553697601147645952.html?push_id=&list=1) | $44 | $15 from aliexpress |

As you see, the CJ products' costs are higher than the selling prices from other Chinese merchants. Given the easiness of finding cheaper similar products and the big price gap, I am not confident CJ products work for dropshipping!

# Products shipping, return :thumbsdown:
CJ products do not have brands which is not ideal for search engines. Google needs GTIN/UPC/MPN to show a product in US. Unfortunately, none of these are provided by CJ products. Missing identifiers and brands make it hard to do SEO for CJ products.

From a price perspective, it could be a pyramid: very few high-priced products (>$1000) on the top and more low-priced products on the bottom. The high price products such as e-bikes have high shipping costs.

CJ does have warehouses in different countries. However, the products available in US warehouses are very limited and most time I have to rely on Chinese warehouses. This means CJ may not work for TikTok US store which requires products using US warehouses.

Regarding return/refund and after-sale service, CJ provides a [dispute policy](https://cjdropshipping.com/article-details/172) for all suppliers. Merchants need to dispute via CJ with suppliers. This could be slow, untransparent, and may not work for E-commerce platforms like Google Shop, Amazon, and Pinterest require (and enforce) clear return policies. CJ support assured me they quality-check products before shipping and I don't have enough experience to comment.

The images in CJ listings are OK for most stores but not for Pinterest because their resolution is not as high as the required 1000x1500. So I cannot import CJ products to Pinterest.

# E-commerce platforms integration 
## listing importing :thumbsup:
Does it support multiple stores? I need to experiment with different stores as mentioned above. Yes, CJ supports all my stores (and much more) except Amazon.

Is it easy to import products to these stores? It is time-consuming and error-prone to copy-paste the product listings (e.g. description, images, videos, product variants) from CJ to stores. There is no way to use dropshipping as a side job without automation. Fortunately, it is easy to import CJ listing into Shopify, Wed2c, and eBay. Shopify needs a little manual work (make the inventory tracked by CJ) after importing.

TikTok importing is challenging because many products do not have US inventory. I can only succeed by 1/10 chance.

CJ does not support Amazon importing. But it is not alone, other alternatives (e.g. [hustle got real](https://hustlegotreal.com/en/)) cannot either. Amazon is not friendly for small dropshippers because:
* most products are protected by brand and you need to ask for approval before selling. You cannot sell a similar product without a brand.
* A product needs an [asin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Standard_Identification_Number) number to be sold on Amazon. Getting a new asin seems to be a PITA (e.g. need a brand). It is also hard to reuse an existing asin because it is hard to find an existing Amazon product exactly matching the CJ product you want to sell. I tried to follow [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQpLLURpgAM) to do dropshipping on Amazon and found that I didn't have the luck to find an exactly matching product shown in the video.

Sometimes, a merchant wants to bulk import a bunch of CJ products for efficiency. CJ lets you add the products into a queue and bulk import the queue to your stores. This is neat.  

I want to emphasize that it is free to import CJ products to my stores. Otherwise, you need to buy/subscribe apps (e.g. [autods](https://www.autods.com/), [dsers](https://www.dsers.com/)) to do so. 

## Auto inventory tracking :thumbsup:
When a product runs out of inventory in CJ warehouses, I want my store to know and stop selling automatically. It is good news that CJ does this for you so that you don't need to buy Shopify apps for this.

# Customer service :thumbsup:
CJ bridges merchants and suppliers and helps CJ customers with any questions related to CJ. They provide support via WhatsApp. The representatives are patient and helpful, especially if you can speak Chinese. They value customer reviews. Two representatives asked me to include their names in my review because it would help their review of the work.

On the other hand, their IT support uses CJ ticketing system instead of WhatsApp and the communication is not smooth. I have a CJ API question which took several rounds of back and forth. The CJ IT did not ask good questions and the answer is not on the point.


# Supplier accessibility :thumbsdown:
It is a known issue for sourcing from China for many reasons. I want to know if CJ can help (e.g. provide reviews, suppliers contact for clarifying return policy).

CJ does not provide any supplier info. All communication goes through CJ. This is understandable due to CJ business model. But also because of this, it could be inflexible and hurt my business.

I tried to search the suppliers online. For example, many products are provided by `Yiwu Renfan Trading Co., LTD` and `Heyang Industrial Co., Ltd`. I thought it is easy to find their contact online. To my surprise, they either don't show or show multiple results on Google or Baidu (a China search engine). [One result](https://www.ltddir.com/companies/heyang-supply-chain-hk-co-limited/) of Heyang does not show phone or email. This makes me wonder whether these suppliers' identities are hidden for some reason.


# Summary

Dropshipping sourced from CJ might not be as profitable as before for several reasons. CJ's high product costs can hardly compete with other Chinese merchants like Temu. Unreliable shipping/return causes a headache sooner or later. CJ's products are unfriendly to search engines which turns off an important marketing channel. On the other hand, CJ is free, easy to import products into a bunch of e-commerce platforms, and auto-tracking inventory making it a great fit for evaluating the dropshipping business model. CJ has many other cool features that are not covered in this post such as private warehouses, and private labels. Given I am a newcomer to dropshipping, please take a grain of salt when reading this post.
